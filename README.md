## OVERVIEW
Human beings are social animals and there are points in life when we look back on our journey to reflect and connect with classmates. Many universities in the world have a listing of the classes of various years, like class of 20xx but not all institutions(tutors, dance classes, creative arts institutes, schools) have the technical knowledge to set this up and keep it up to date.  Several institution websites lack utility features like graphing / profile updates etc which can help keep it better updated. This project would fix the above mentioned issues. 

## FEATURES & IMPLEMENTATION
**Web Application Features:**
* Multiple account types, like admin provision to add ‘n’ types of roles.
* Authentication using passport to enable login from Google, Facebook, etc.
* Admin users can create new teams like class of 20xx.
* Upon event completion(example: graduation, course completion etc.) all members are added to the team recreating memory like class-photograph.
* Individual users can accept the invite of the admin, and show their listing in the teams they like.
* Individual profile page where user can update info about themselves which is automatically updated for all teams.
* Option to download a static copy of the document for all teams.

**Tech Implementation**
* Server in NodeJS
* Database: MongoDB
* Deployment using Docker, CI
* Testing using Jest, Mocha, Chai
* Documentation using JSdocs
* Auth using JWT

## CHALLENGES AHEAD
* Writing an application in Express
* Writing Frontend in Bootstrap, (separate/integrated TBD)
* Writing Middleware to Authenticate
* Writing documentation like professionals, using JSdocs
* Writing Unit Tests

**Future Ahead:** 
* Not much admin required  after creating v1.0, can be continued till implementation
* Scope of adding React, Redux in future if needed.
* Additional features that usual social networks have can also be added.
